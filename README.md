# Pinocchio Template

A simple Solana program template built with the Pinocchio framework for high-performance program development.

## Features

- ðŸš€ **High Performance**: Built with Pinocchio - Low CU BABY!
- ðŸ§ª **Testing Ready**: Complete test suite using `solana-program-test` - the best balance between control and overhead
- ðŸ“¦ **Modular Design**: Clean separation between program, SDK, CLI, and tests
- ðŸ”§ **Developer Friendly**: No magic black box - all in simple Rust!

## Installation

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd pinocchio-template
./test.sh
```

## Design Decisions

Inspired by: https://github.com/Nagaprasadvr/solana-pinocchio-starter

- **No Direct Dependencies**: No crate should use `pinocchio-template-example-program` directly - the SDK forwards all important exports
- **Zero-Copy Performance**: Uses Pinocchio for minimal runtime overhead
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Uses Solana Program Test for integration tests with realistic program interactions. Local validator and other testing frameworks did not meet our needs.
- **Workspace Structure**: Organized as a Cargo workspace for better dependency management
